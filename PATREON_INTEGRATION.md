# Patreon Integration Configuration

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the Patreon integration to work properly:

### Backend Environment Variables

Add these to your backend `.env` file:

```bash
# Patreon OAuth Configuration
PATREON_CLIENT_ID=your_patreon_client_id
PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET=your_patreon_client_secret
PATREON_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:1959/callback

# Patreon Webhook Configuration
PATREON_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_patreon_webhook_secret
```

### Frontend Environment Variables

The frontend will automatically use the correct OAuth flow through the Tauri backend, so no additional environment variables are needed.

## Setting Up Patreon OAuth Application

1. Go to [Patreon Developer Portal](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients)
2. Create a new client application
3. Set the redirect URI to: `http://localhost:1959/callback`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your backend `.env` file
5. Set up webhook endpoint (optional, for real-time subscription updates):
   - Webhook URL: `https://your-backend-domain.com/v1/webhooks/payments/patreon`
   - Events: `members:create`, `members:update`, `members:delete`, `members:pledge:create`, `members:pledge:update`, `members:pledge:delete`

## OAuth Flow Architecture

The new Patreon integration follows the same pattern as Discord/Twitch integrations:

1. **Frontend initiates OAuth**: User clicks "Connect Patreon" button
2. **Tauri opens browser**: `start_patreon_auth()` command opens Patreon OAuth URL
3. **User authorizes**: User completes OAuth flow in browser
4. **Rust captures callback**: Minimal HTTP server on port 1959 receives the callback
5. **Forward to backend**: Rust sends the authorization code to the backend API
6. **Backend processes**: Backend exchanges code for tokens and links the account
7. **Update UI**: Frontend receives success event and refreshes user data

## Webhook Processing

The backend automatically processes Patreon webhooks to keep user subscription data up-to-date:

- **Member events**: Handle account creation, updates, and deletions
- **Pledge events**: Handle subscription changes, cancellations, and tier changes
- **Security**: All webhooks are validated using MD5 signature verification

## Supported Patreon Tiers

The system supports the following tier structure:

- **Basic Tier**: $3+ per month
  - Custom cover images
  - Priority support

- **Premium Tier**: $5+ per month
  - All Basic features
  - Early access to new features
  - Exclusive modpacks

- **Elite Tier**: $10+ per month
  - All Premium features
  - Custom badges
  - Beta feature access

## Testing the Integration

1. Start the backend server with the environment variables configured
2. Start the frontend application
3. Navigate to Profile â†’ Integrations
4. Click "Connect Patreon"
5. Complete the OAuth flow in the browser
6. Check that the connection status is updated in the UI

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Issues
- Ensure the redirect URI matches exactly: `http://localhost:1959/callback`
- Check that all environment variables are properly set
- Verify that port 1959 is not blocked by firewall

### Webhook Issues
- Verify webhook secret is correctly configured
- Check backend logs for webhook processing errors
- Ensure webhook URL is publicly accessible (for production)

### UI Issues
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify that the Tauri commands are properly registered
- Ensure the backend API endpoints are responding correctly
