# ðŸ“š Biblioteca de Modpacks - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The Library section has been successfully implemented as a Steam-inspired modpack library for ModpackStore.

## Features

### âœ… Core Features Implemented
- **Library View**: Grid layout displaying all acquired modpacks
- **Installation Status**: Green checkmark badges for installed modpacks
- **Smart Filtering**: 
  - All modpacks
  - Installed modpacks
  - Not installed modpacks
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Loading states and error recovery
- **Navigation Integration**: Added to main header with Library icon

### âœ… Technical Implementation
- **Service**: `getUserAcquisitions.ts` - Fetches user acquisitions from `/explore/user/acquisitions`
- **Component**: `LibrarySection.tsx` - Main library view component
- **Navigation**: Updated `HomeMainHeader.tsx` with Library navigation item
- **Routing**: Added `/library` route in `App.tsx`

### âœ… Integration Points
- Uses existing `ModpackCard` component for consistent UI

- Follows established UI patterns from `MyInstancesSection` and `ExploreSection`

## UI Description

The Library section features:

1. **Header**: Purple gradient title with description
2. **Filter Bar**: Three filter buttons showing counts for:
   - Todos (X) - All acquired modpacks
   - Instalados (X) - Installed modpacks only
   - No instalados (X) - Not installed modpacks only
3. **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid showing modpack cards
4. **Installation Badges**: Green badges with checkmarks overlay installed modpacks
5. **Empty States**: Contextual messages when no modpacks match filters
6. **Loading State**: Armadillo loading animation while fetching data

## Steam-like Design Elements

- Card-based grid layout similar to Steam Library
- Hover effects on modpack cards
- Clear visual distinction between installed/not installed items
- Filter system for organizing large collections
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `application/src/services/getUserAcquisitions.ts`
- `application/src/views/LibrarySection.tsx`

### Modified Files
- `application/src/App.tsx` - Added library route
- `application/src/components/home/MainHeader.tsx` - Added library navigation

## Usage

Users can access the Library by clicking the "Biblioteca" tab in the main navigation. The section will:

1. Fetch all modpacks the user has acquired
2. Check installation status for each modpack
3. Display them in a filterable grid
4. Show visual indicators for installed modpacks
5. Allow filtering by installation status

The implementation is ready for testing with real user data and modpack acquisitions.
