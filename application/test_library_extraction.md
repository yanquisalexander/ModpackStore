# Library Extraction Improvements Test

## Enhanced Native Library Detection

The following improvements have been made to detect and extract native libraries more accurately:

### 1. Enhanced Detection Patterns
- **LWJGL libraries**: Detects `org.lwjgl.tinyfd` and other LWJGL native components
- **JInput libraries**: Detects native input libraries
- **Platform-specific libraries**: Improved detection of OS-specific components
- **Forge-specific patterns**: Better support for modded library detection

### 2. Improved Path Resolution
- **Multiple classifier strategies**: Tries various native classifier patterns
- **Maven coordinate fallback**: Constructs paths from Maven coordinates when download info is missing
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed information about path resolution attempts

### 3. Better Error Handling
- **Fallback reporting**: Reports missing libraries without crashing the installation
- **Detailed logging**: Clear traceability of what's downloaded and extracted
- **Duplicate detection**: Avoids re-extracting existing files

### 4. Enhanced Exclusion Patterns
- **Improved defaults**: Better patterns for excluding unnecessary files
- **Forge-specific exclusions**: Patterns tailored for modded environments

## Test Cases to Verify

1. **Test with vanilla Minecraft**: Ensure standard LWJGL extraction works
2. **Test with Forge**: Verify Forge-specific native libraries are detected
3. **Test with missing libraries**: Confirm graceful degradation and error reporting
4. **Test duplicate detection**: Verify no unnecessary re-extraction

## Expected Behavior

- All native libraries should be detected and extracted to `/natives/{version}/`
- Libraries like `org.lwjgl.tinyfd` should be properly resolved and extracted
- Clear logs should show what was downloaded, extracted, and any issues
- Missing libraries should be reported but not crash the installation
