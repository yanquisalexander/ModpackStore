# LoadingIndicator State Management Test

## Enhanced State Management

The following improvements have been made to fix LoadingIndicator state issues:

### 1. State Clearing Before Launch
- **Clear previous messages**: Removes old messages before starting new instance
- **Reset timers**: Clears all message rotation timers
- **Fresh state**: Ensures clean starting state for each instance launch

### 2. Instance-Specific Message Tracking
- **Instance-aware messaging**: Messages are tracked per instance ID
- **Prevents cross-contamination**: Old messages from previous instances don't show
- **Enhanced cleanup**: Proper cleanup when switching between instances

### 3. Improved Timer Management
- **Proper cleanup**: All timers are cleared when instances stop
- **Memory leak prevention**: Timers don't persist between instance launches
- **State synchronization**: Loading state properly reflects current instance status

## Test Cases to Verify

1. **Single instance launch**: Verify clean loading indicator
2. **Multiple launches**: Ensure no old messages show between launches
3. **Instance switching**: Confirm proper state cleanup when changing instances
4. **Exit message handling**: Verify "Minecraft has exited with exit code 0" doesn't persist

## Expected Behavior

- LoadingIndicator should show fresh messages for each instance launch
- No residual messages from previous sessions should appear
- State should be properly reset between different instance launches
- Clean and consistent user experience across all instance operations
